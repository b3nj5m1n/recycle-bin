# line_intersect_test

A small 'game' where the objective is not to hit the other players line.

A friend of mine wrote this while learning how to program, but couldn't figure out how to add collision detection. This is my sad attempt at implementing it myself.

It seems to work only on the first move, it's probably a simple fix but I currently have no motivation to work on this.
