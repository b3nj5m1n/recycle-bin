# deck_of_cards

I wanted to learn how to count cards, so I wrote this.

It was my first time using rich, so the interface is shit.

If you run card_counting_trainer.py, (and have the required dependencies installed, and a proper terminal (so if you're on windows this might not work)) you'll see a list of cards, calculate the count, then enter that count. Because of the limited amount of time I spent on this, you will not be able to see what you have entered so far. Just have faith that it's there. Press enter when you're done.
