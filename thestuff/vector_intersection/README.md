# vector_intersection

An attempt at calculating the intersection point of two lines using vectors.

I wrote this for the line_intersect_test, so this is very much bodged together.

I don't even think it really works correctly in every case, and even if it did, the way I implemented this is pretty horrible, so don't use this, don't look at the code, just forget this exists.
